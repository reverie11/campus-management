# About Campus Management C++ Object Orientation
This project is actually an assignment from the course "Fortgeschrittene Algortihmen und Programmieren" at 
HTW Berlin (Hochschule f√ºr Technick und Wirtschaft Berlin). 
It serves as practice to object orientation, polymorphism, class, inheritance.\\

## Summary of the Assignments
Basically, we need to program a campus management system:
The following classes have to be constructed: University, Student, Teacher, Course.
Then we have to define how these classes interact with each other. 
Let's say we construct a university class, how would we program it so that student can enroll in this university,
or how teachers can be hired and how much they should be paid, or what courses are offered.
